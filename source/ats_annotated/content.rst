Annotated ATS Programs
=============================================

Goal
----------------------------------------------

The normal way to start up a programming project using ATS is via imitating an existing
example. The website serves as a collection of such examples along with intensive
comments about the usage of ATS in these examples.

These examples come primarily from the `Google group for ATS`_.

Examples
---------

WireShark has been installed on all the Windows machines in the Instructional Lab (EMA 302). It is only usable during the period of the lab session.
