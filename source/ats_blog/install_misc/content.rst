Miscellaneous topics related to ATS-Postiats
==============================================

Setting of Environment
-----------------------

Please follow the instructions on `ATS' website`_ to install *ATS-Postiats* as well as
*ATS2-contrib*. Here I just want to emphasize the setting of environment
variables *PATSHOME* as well as *PATSHOMERELOC*. These two variables should be
set in the environment before invoking the ATS compiler (*patscc* or *patsopt*).
Also they are commonly referred in *Makefile* used in ATS projects. The first
one (*PATSHOME*) should be set to the directory where ATS is installed. Normally I just
download tarball for the source of ATS, decompress it, build ATS, and use
built executables. (Simply put, I don't do ``make install``.) 
Therefore I just set *PATSHOME* to the folder resulting from
decompressing the tarball. *PATSHOMERELOC* should be set to the folder
resulting for decompress the tarball for *ATS2-contrib*. Also the *PATH*
variable should be set accordingly so that system can locate the compiler of
ATS. Normally, I put these settings into one script file, say *pats.xxx.sh*.
Then I do ``source pats.xxx.sh`` when I open a terminal for the first time.
My *pats.xxx.sh* looks like the following:

.. literalinclude:: pats.xxx.sh
   :language: bash

If you use ``make install`` to install ATS at the system level, your script would probably be
like the following:

.. literalinclude:: pats.installed.sh
   :language: bash

.. note::

   Since we choose to install ATS at the system level, there's no need to set *PATH*.
